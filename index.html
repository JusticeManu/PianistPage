            <h1>Piano lessons by Connie</h1>
            <p>
              Learning to play piano can seem like a pretty big challenge for a
              beginner. You might be staring at your keyboard right now,
              wondering ‘where do I even start?But don’t let all those keys
              intimidate you! Making sense of the keyboard is actually quite
              simple, you just have to know what to look out for.
